nvim config is me following theprimeagen's 0 to lsp video
Waybar config is based on the user abhinaya-aryal's config
I don't remember the source for my base rofi config but apparently it is from some
guy named deadguy. I'm pretty sure I found it from some big collection of themes.
Thanks to bluer222 and ChatGPT for helping me write some parts of my config.
